# Number-Plate-Detection
It reads an image, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, and applies noise removal. Then, it detects edges and finds contours based on those edges. The code selects the contour with four corners, which is assumed to represent the number plate. Finally, it draws the detected number plate contour on the original image and displays the result.
